# Sideline Secrets: Why I Capture Athletic Moments That Matter

After 20 years behind the lens, sports photography has become my true passion over the past five years. As a teacher, I witness a completely different side of my students when I see them competing on fields and courts compared to our classroom interactions. There's something magical about helping young athletes find success in competition; it's both rewarding and tremendously fun.

Since I can't coach every student (not everyone chooses soccer or tennis), photography offers me another avenue to connect with them beyond academics. I get to witness and preserve their athletic journeys through my camera.

## Why This Matters to Me

My passion stems from personal experience. I remember playing soccer for the Charlottesville Express. I remember the exact color of my kit, the long drives my parents made to watch me play on cold Saturday mornings in Richmond. The memories are vivid: playing under the lights as team captain and sweeper in high school, being the leading scorer on my team as a sophomore in college, then becoming a captain as a junior. Most of all I love being a part of the team.

But I have no photographs to relive those moments. You can look up my college stats sheet, but there are no images of me in action. This absence is something I deeply regret, and it fuels my passion for sports photography today. I want my students to have what I don't: the ability to look back and see the amazing moments from their middle and high school athletic careers.

## The Secret to Great Sports Photos

People often ask how I capture such compelling images. While quality equipment helps, the more important factor is knowing where to be and when to be there. My athletic background gives me an intimate understanding of multiple sports, helping me anticipate action, position myself effectively, and capture the decisive moment.

The key is capturing both the action and the athlete's face. While there are artistic exceptions, seeing the emotion on a player's face when they score the game-winning goal transforms a good photo into a memorable one.

## Technical Tips for Freezing Action

In spring's outdoor lighting conditions, I typically set my shutter speed to 1/2000 second. I can go as high as 1/8000, but the images start becoming grainy beyond 1/4000. I aim to keep my aperture as wide open as possible (ideally around f/2.8, though I'm often at f/4 or f/5.6 when using my 100-500mm f/4 lens for greater reach). For sports like basketball or wrestling, my 70-200mm f/2.8 lens helps maintain a wider aperture in indoor settings.

## Equipment and Composition Advice

If I could recommend just one piece of equipment, it would be a 70-200mm f/2.8 lens. However, I frequently reach for my 100-500mm when shooting larger fields.

For composition, create depth in your images. I often include slightly blurred players in the foreground while focusing on action happening downfield. Pay careful attention to backgrounds; nothing ruins a great sports photo like a bright blue porta-potty behind your subject!

## Why It All Matters

Providing high-quality images to my students, their parents, and families has become deeply important to me. I wish I could travel back in time and have someone photograph me during my prime playing years. Not having those images remains one of my biggest regrets.

I hope the moments I capture allow parents to preserve these fleeting athletic achievements; images they can share with their children when they become grandparents themselves. These aren't just photos; they're tangible memories of formative experiences that shape who we become.
