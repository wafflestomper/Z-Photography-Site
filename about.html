                        <p>
                            I'm a middle school math teacher living in Richmond, VA, who's always been passionate about sports and working with kids. Growing up, my brother and I would play every sport we possibly could—if it had a ball, we were out there playing it. I went on to play soccer in college and later picked up tennis as an adult, but my love for all things sports has never faded.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've been a photographer for the past twenty years, but over the last five, I've really fallen in love with sports photography. It's become the perfect outlet for my creativity and a way to stay connected to the world of athletics in a meaningful way. I didn't have many photos to look back on from my own playing days, and I've always wished I did. That's a big part of why I love doing this—capturing those "remember when" moments for today's athletes: the big wins, the hard-fought battles, the goal, the record, <span class="highlight-text">that</span> game. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Even though photography isn't my full-time job, it's something I pour my heart into. It's a passion I truly enjoy—and I take pride in delivering high-quality images that athletes and their families can look back on for years to come.
                        </p>
